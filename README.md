# Vue.js 3 Image Gallery

This project is a simple image gallery built with Vue.js 3 and TailwindCSS. It allows users to browse through a collection of images displayed in a responsive grid. Users can click on an image to view it in a larger modal window, with the ability to navigate through the images using next and previous buttons.

## Features

- **Responsive Image Grid:** Displays images in a grid that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Image Modal:** Clicking on an image opens it in a modal, with options to navigate between images.
- **Navigation:** Allows users to navigate through images in the modal, with wrapping from the last image back to the first and vice versa.
